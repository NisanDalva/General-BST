# General-BST
Here's a little program to examine a general Binary Search Tree.
For example, I created a struct called 'Person' with just name and age. We can see at that example how the functions works and can be work on any other struct or primitive variable, according to the functions that fits to its own struct.
Hence, we can build a BST that will not only compare integers, can also compare between strings, structs, etc.
